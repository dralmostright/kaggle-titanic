### Executive Summary:
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this challenge, we will perform analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we have done feature engineering, imputation of missing values and random forest machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

### Cleaning Data and Imputation
From the summary of the data above we got our data have some missing values. In this section we are going to fix and imputate the missing values.

#### Cleaning and imputation of AGE
From Summary of the data we can observe that the Age variable has some missing values. We will be developing and implementing workaround to deal with missing values.
```{r echo=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
sum(is.na(trailData$Age))
```

To impute the age, lets introduce a new variable Age categorey using below rule:

1) If (number of spouses or siblings > 1) then it's probably a child and represented by 0
2) If (number of parents or children > 2) then it's probably an adult and represented by 1
3) If all above conditions are not met lets call it is unterermined and represented by 2
```{r}
trailData <- mutate(trailData, AgeCat = ifelse(SibSp > 1 , 0, ifelse(Parch > 2, 1, 2)))
```

Building model to predict age.
```{r echo=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
ageModel = rpart(Age ~ Fare + Pclass + SibSp + Parch + AgeCat, data = trailData)
trailData$predictAge = predict(ageModel,trailData)
trailData$Age <- ifelse(is.na(trailData$Age), trailData$predictAge, trailData$Age)

## Check if any NA values are there 
numOfNa <- sum(is.na(trailData$Age))
numOfNa
```

With successful imputation of age variables, there are `r numOfNa` NA's in AGE variables.

#### Cleaning and imputation of Embarked
There are smome empty values for variable Embarked. In this section we will expore and clean the missing data.
```{r echo=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
## Check if Embarked is missing & if missing show respective index
which(trailData$Embarked=="")
```
From above we can see two values for embarked missing. We will use the existing data to predict the empty data.

```{r echo=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
trailData[trailData$Embarked=="",]
```

Going in detail we find that the data with missing embarked have same ticked num and same cabin are from same passenger class. Hence lets build a model based on fare and passenger class.

```{r}
trailData$Embarked <- as.factor(trailData$Embarked)
emptyEmbarked <- which(trailData$Embarked=="")
embarkedModel <- train( Embarked ~ Pclass + Fare, data = trailData, method="rpart", na.action = na.pass);
trailData$Embarked[emptyEmbarked] <- predict(embarkedModel, trailData[emptyEmbarked, ])
```

#### Cleaning and imputation of Fare
Now its turn to clean and impute missing values for Fare variables. There is 1 missing values for Fear variable. First let's look for the while row.

```{r echo=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
sum(is.na(trailData$Fare))
trailData[is.na(trailData$Fare),]
```
We are going to build a model to predict the fare on basis of variables:

```{r echo=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
fareModel <- rpart(Fare ~ Age + Pclass + Embarked + SibSp + Parch , data = trailData)
emptyFare <- which(is.na(trailData$Fare))
trailData$Fare[emptyFare] <- predict(fareModel, trailData[emptyFare, ])
sum(is.na(trailData$Fare))
```

#### Cleaning and imputation of Cabin
First lets count the number of missing values for the Cabin variable.
```{r echo=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
count <- length(which(trailData$Cabin==""))
count
```

The toatl empty values for variable Cabin is: `r count`. There are too many empty values so we will drop this feature entirely to avoid
the risk of adding noise by filling in predicted values.


### Exploratory Data analysis

In this section we will visualize the given data for some exploratory data analysis and visualize relationship between other features and Survival. All the plots are based train data. 

#### Men and Women Survived by Passenger Class
We had draw a plot on for Men/Women Survived by passengre class. For the plot below we can visualize that there were more female survival for each passenger class. [Refer appendix for code.]

```{r echo=FALSE}
trnData <- trailData[trailData$sample=="training",]
plot <- ggplot(trnData, aes(Pclass, fill = factor(Survived))) 
plot <- plot + geom_bar(stat='count', position='dodge') 
plot <- plot + facet_grid( Sex ~ . ) + coord_flip()
plot <- plot + labs(title="Men and Women Survived by Passenger Class", x = "Ticket class accorinding to socio-economic status", y ="Survival Count" , fill = "Survival")
plot
```

#### Passengers per Boarding Location
Next we have ploted plot with passengers with boarding location and their survival count and there ratio of survial was high for boarding location "C". [Refer appendix for code.]

```{r echo= FALSE}
plot2 <- ggplot(trnData, aes(x = Embarked, fill = factor(Survived)))
plot2 <- plot2 + geom_bar(stat='count', position='dodge')
plot2 <- plot2 + ggtitle('Passengers per Boarding Location and Survival rate.')
plot2 <- plot2 + ylab('Survival Count')
plot2 <- plot2 + xlab('Boarding Location') + theme_minimal()
plot2 <- plot2 +  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Survival")
plot2
```

#### Survival by Age, Sex and Fare
From plot below, Survival by Age, Sex and Fare we can obeserve female passengers with age 16-50 survived more and also who paid high fare survivied more. [Refer appendix for code.]

```{r echo = FALSE}
plot <- ggplot(trnData, aes(x = Age, y = Fare)) 
plot <- plot + geom_point(aes(shape = factor(Survived), colour= factor(Survived))) 
plot <- plot + facet_grid( Sex ~ . ) + coord_flip()
plot <- plot + labs(title="Survival by Age, Sex and Fare", x = "Age Of Passengers", y ="Fare passengers paid" , fill = "Survival")
plot
```

### Feature Engineering:

#### Stronger vs Weak
It is obvious that, we can assume that stronger can swim more than weaker ones. So I would like to categorize age into
Child/Adult/Old  variables. Categorizing is done:

1. age <= 50 => Old
2. age < 16 => Child
3. Other => Adult
```{r echo=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
trailData <- mutate(trailData, fitness = as.factor(ifelse(trailData$Age <=16 , "Child", ifelse(trailData$Age >=50, "Old", "Adult"))))

## View the Fitness Vs Sex distribution
table(trailData$Sex,trailData$fitness)
```
Now its more obvious that there were more Adult and Child survivals and can also be witnessed by below plot.

```{r echo=FALSE}
trnData <- trailData[trailData$sample=="training",]
plot <- ggplot(trnData, aes(Pclass, fill = factor(Survived))) 
plot <- plot + geom_bar(stat='count', position='dodge')
plot <- plot + facet_grid(Sex ~ fitness )
plot <- plot + labs(title="Men and Women Survived by Passenger Class and Physical fitness", x = "Ticket class accorinding to socio-economic status", y ="Survival Count" , fill = "Survival")
plot
```

#### Family Size 
Now I am focusing on the passengers if they are travelling in family and their survival rate. If they were travelling in family the male member of the family may give importance to other family members. 

```{r}
## Introduce new variable familySize, (+1 is for the individual him or her self)
trailData <- mutate(trailData, familySize = trailData$SibSp + trailData$Parch + 1)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
trnData <- trailData[trailData$sample=="training",]
plot1 <- ggplot(trnData, aes(x = familySize, fill = factor(Survived)))
plot1 <- plot1 + geom_bar(stat='count', position='dodge')
plot1 <- plot1 + ggtitle('Survival according to family size.')
plot1 <- plot1 + ylab('Survival Count')
plot1 <- plot1 + xlab('Family Size') + theme_minimal()
plot1 <- plot1 +  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Survival")
plot1
```

We can observe from the above barchart that the survival rate is high for fmily travelling alone or with fmaily size greater than 4. Hence we will take a step further and categorize the Family size according to following rule:  

1. familySize = 1          => Single
2. familySize > 1 && <=4   => Small
3. familySize > 4          => Big

```{r}
trailData <- mutate(trailData, familyType = as.factor(ifelse(familySize == 1, "Single", ifelse(familySize > 1 & familySize <= 4, "Small", "Big"))))
```
#### Passengers Name:
From plot Survival by Age, Sex and Fare, we got idea that female who paid high fare mostly survived. The Name variable consists of three parts Surname, Title and First Name. We are more interested in title rather than First Name and Surname. In this section we will break the name and extract title.
```{r echo=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
trailData$Title <- gsub('(.*, )|(\\..*)', '', trailData$Name)

## View the raw result: Title Vs Sex distribution
table(trailData$Sex, trailData$Title) 
```
With Successful segregation of of title, lets combine similar titles.
```{r echo=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
trailData$Title <- as.factor(ifelse(trailData$Title == "Mlle", "Miss", ifelse(trailData$Title == "Ms", "Miss", ifelse(trailData$Title == "Mme","Mrs", ifelse(trailData$Title == "Miss", "Miss", ifelse(trailData$Title== "Mrs","Mrs",ifelse(trailData$Title=="Mr", "Mr", ifelse(trailData$Title=="Master","Master","Not Known"))))))))

## View the Title Vs Sex distribution
table(trailData$Sex, trailData$Title) 
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
trnData <- trailData[trailData$sample=="training",]
plot <- ggplot(trnData, aes(factor(Survived), fill=Title ) ) + geom_bar(position="dodge") 
plot <- plot + labs(title="Survival Vs Title", x = "Survival", y ="Count" , fill = "Title")
plot
```

### Prediction
We have cleaning and imputation of data, done some exploratory data analysis and feature engineering. In this section we will use the data and do prediction.

#### Slicing of data
As first step we will first slice the data, that before we merged in respective testing and train datasets.

```{r}
## Set the seed for reproducibililty
set.seed(22519)

## Splitting data sets to respective traning and test sets
tstData <- trailData[trailData$sample=="testing",]
tranData <- trailData[trailData$sample=="training",]
```

#### Data Modelling
Now we will bulit model on basis of traning data set using Random Forest model with 3-fold cross validation.

```{r}
# Train the model using 3-fold CV
fitControl <- trainControl(method="cv", number=3, verboseIter=F)

fit <- train(as.factor(Survived) ~ Pclass + Sex + Age + SibSp + Parch + Fare + Embarked + fitness + familyType + Title, data=tranData, method="rf", trControl=fitControl,importance=TRUE)
```

#### Evaluation and Selection of Model
With building the model now, we will use the model to predict the Survival of passenger from tstData and view the confusion matrix and make comparison wih actual Survival.

We can see from the plot below that the most accurate value for mtry was 10 with an accuracy of 82.38%.

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(fit)
```

Now lets look at the model error. Form the plot below we can observe the mean prediction error (OOB) and error rate for both survival and dead respectively in black, green and red for the model developed.  

```{r echo=FALSE}
finalModel <- fit$finalModel
plot(finalModel)
legend('topright', colnames(finalModel$err.rate), col=1:3, fill=1:3)
```

Lets print the whole mode. The mean prediction error (OOB) for the mode is 17.51%.

```{r echo=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
fit$finalModel
```

#### Prediction on Test Data set.
Now, I apply the model to the original testing data set downloaded from the data source and write those predictions to output file.
```{r}
# Using model to predict Survival for test data set
predict <- predict(fit, newdata=tstData)
#predict

solution <- data.frame(PassengerID = tstData$PassengerId, Survived = predict)
write.csv(solution, file = 'predictionSurvivalTitanic.csv', row.names = F)
```

### Conclusion
As the prediction of survival for titanic dataset is complete. Though mean prediction error is around 18% (approx), its sound for me to accept the solution. As I paced first step in machine learning, will apply more sophisticated algorithms to achive better and accurate predictions.
